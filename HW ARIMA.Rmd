## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



```{r start1}
library(fpp2)
```

Import data set
```{r start2}
data2 <- read.csv("C:/Users/dmkot/Downloads/Unemployment in America Per US State.csv")
str(data2)
data3 = data2[data2$State.Area == "New Jersey",]
head(data3)
```

The time series plot shows signs of seasonality 
```{r myts}
myts = ts(data3$Percent.....of.Labor.Force.Unemployed.in.State.Area, start=c(1976,1), end=c(2019,12), frequency=12)
plot(myts, ylab="Unemployment Rate %")

```


The Acf shows 27 significant lag spikes 
```{r Acf}
Acf(myts)
```

Decomposition shows we have seasonality although the range is rather small. We have an additive time series.
```{r decomp}
plot(decompose(myts))
```

Number of differences required for a stationery series is 1. 
```{r diffs}
ndiffs(myts) # 
nsdiffs(myts)
```

There are quite a few signifcant lag spikes in the Acf and PAcf. When you remove the seasonality component it is 0
```{r dis}
tsdisplay(diff(myts,4))
ndiffs(diff(myts,4))

```


There are only 2 significant lag spikes. 
```{r tsdis}
tsdisplay(diff(diff(euretail,4)))
```
The best model is: ARIMA(1,1,2)(0,0,2)[12] 
The standard error is very very low. The sigma^2 is also very very low
```{r fit}
fit33=auto.arima(myts, stepwise=FALSE, approximation=FALSE, trace=TRUE)
fit33
```

There is no obvious pattern. The residuals appear to be random 
```{r res}
res = residuals(fit33)
plot(res)
```

There is a significant lag spike at 23
```{r tsdisss}
tsdisplay(res)
```

The histogram of the residuals is normally distributed 
```{r hist}
hist(res)
```
Forecast for the next 24 months shows a slight upward trend then turns into a slow declining dip
```{r fcast}
fcast=forecast(fit33,h=24)
plot(fcast)
```

The forecast appears to be extremely accurate since the red line (forecast) and black line (ts) are very similar
```{r plot w}
plot(myts)
lines(fcast$fitted, col="red")
```

The RMSE is .063 which is extremely low. The Best model: ARIMA(1,1,2)(0,0,2)[12] 
```{r acc}
accuracy(fcast)
```
